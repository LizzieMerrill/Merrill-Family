                Sarah Merrill, MD, MS earned her medical degree from the Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine and her undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College. Merrill also received a master's degree in the science of health care delivery from the Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University. Her research interests include investigating treatments for CNS tumors and improving outcomes for disadvantaged patients.
    
    Within neurosurgery, Merrill loves the variety of pathology encountered and the frequent opportunities to help high acuity patients and their loved ones through difficult times. As a neurological surgery resident at Indiana University School of Medicine, Merrill is interested in ultimately pursuing a practice in tumor, skull base or pediatric neurosurgery.
    
    Outside of the hospital, she enjoys spending time with her husband and nine children, playing the piano, running and traveling.
